NAME
    Kwiki::ModPerl - enable Kwiki to work under mod_perl

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to use Kwiki as a mod_perl content handler.

FEATURES, BUGS and NOTES
    * Multiple Kwikis are supported.
        As long as each Kwiki has its own KwikiBaseDir, you're golden.

    * You might need a redirect for the Kwiki base directory.
        For example, if your Kwiki is at the location "/kwiki/" and you
        browse to "/kwiki" (without the trailing slash), you'll definitely
        experience some weirdness. I highly suggest adding a redirect:

            RedirectMatch ^/kwiki$ http://example.com/kwiki/

    * Yes, viewing index.cgi shows the source of the CGI script.
        Don't worry, it's not executing it. It probably similar to the
        index.cgi included with Kwiki, anyway.

    * You might need to restart Apache.
        Otherwise module additions and removal might not be working.
